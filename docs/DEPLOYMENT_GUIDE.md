### Deploying to Vercel

#### Option 1: Connect Git Repository (Recommended)

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Configure project settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Root Directory**: `./`
   - **Build Command**: `pnpm build`
   - **Install Command**: `pnpm install`
4. Click **Deploy**

#### Option 2: Vercel CLI Deployment

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
pnpm add -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Post-Deployment Tasks

#### Database Setup
- [ ] Run database migrations: `pnpm db:migrate`
- [ ] Verify Row Level Security (RLS) policies are enabled
- [ ] Test database connections

#### Stripe Configuration
- [ ] Configure Stripe webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- [ ] Test webhook delivery with Stripe CLI
- [ ] Verify products and prices are configured

#### Email Delivery
- [ ] Send test email to verify configuration
- [ ] Check spam/junk folder settings
- [ ] Configure email domain authentication (SPF/DKIM)

#### Admin Access
- [ ] Create admin account using CLI script
- [ ] Test admin portal login at `/secure-admin-gateway/login`
- [ ] Verify admin dashboard loads correctly

#### Critical Functionality
- [ ] Test user registration and login
- [ ] Test subscription creation with Stripe test cards
- [ ] Test letter generation flow
- [ ] Test admin review workflow
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is active

#### Security Verification
- [ ] Confirm `ENABLE_TEST_MODE=false` in production
- [ ] Verify security headers are applied
- [ ] Test CSP headers with security scanner
- [ ] Check for exposed environment variables

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Failures

```bash
# Run locally to identify issues
pnpm build
```

**Solution**: Fix type errors before deploying. Do not disable `ignoreBuildErrors`.

#### Function Timeouts

**Issue**: AI generation timing out

**Solution**: `vercel.json` already configures extended timeouts:
- `/api/generate-letter`: 60 seconds
- `/api/stripe/webhook`: 30 seconds

#### Webhook Failures

**Solutions**:
1. Verify webhook secret matches Vercel environment variable
2. Check webhook endpoint is reachable
3. Review Stripe webhook delivery logs

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions with three main workflows:

1. **`ci-cd.yml`** - Main CI/CD pipeline with build, test, and deployment
2. **`auto-pr.yml`** - Automated pull request creation for maintenance tasks
3. **`dependabot.yml`** - Automated dependency updates

### Main CI/CD Pipeline Jobs

#### 1. Lint & Type Check
- Runs ESLint for code quality
- Performs TypeScript type checking
- Continues on error to allow other jobs

#### 2. Build Application
- Builds Next.js application with CI=1
- Uses placeholder env vars for public variables
- Uploads build artifacts
- Depends on successful lint/type check

#### 3. Security Audit
- Runs `pnpm audit` for vulnerabilities
- Checks for outdated dependencies
- Continues on error

#### 4. Auto-fix & Commit
- Automatically fixes linting issues
- Commits and pushes fixes back to branch
- **Only runs on push to non-main branches**
- Skips CI with `[skip ci]` tag

#### 5. Deploy to Vercel
- Deploys to Vercel production
- **Only runs on pushes to `main` branch**
- Requires `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret
- Posts deployment status as commit comment

### Required GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

```
VERCEL_TOKEN          - Vercel deployment token
GITHUB_TOKEN          - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
```

### Workflow Behavior

#### On Feature Branch Push
```
Lint → Build → Security Audit → Auto-fix & Commit
```

#### On Pull Request to Main
```
Lint → Build → Security Audit
```
(Auto-fix does not run on PRs)

#### On Push to Main
```
Lint → Build → Security Audit → Deploy to Vercel
```

#### Weekly (via Dependabot)
```
Check Dependencies → Create Grouped PRs
```

### Dependabot Configuration

#### Package Ecosystems Monitored

**npm/pnpm Dependencies**
- **Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 09:00 UTC
- **Max Open PRs**: 10

**GitHub Actions**
- **Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 09:00 UTC
- **Max Open PRs**: 5

#### Dependency Grouping

Dependencies are grouped to reduce PR noise:
- **radix-ui** - All Radix UI components
- **dev-dependencies** - All dev dependencies
- **react** - React and React-related packages
- **nextjs** - Next.js packages (patch only)
- **typescript** - TypeScript and type definitions
- **stripe** - Stripe packages
- **supabase** - Supabase packages
- **tailwind** - TailwindCSS packages
- **github-actions** - All GitHub Actions
