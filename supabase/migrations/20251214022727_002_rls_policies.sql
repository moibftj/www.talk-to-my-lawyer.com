  # Row Level Security Policies

  1. Security Overview
    - Subscribers can only access their own data
    - Employees can access their coupons and commissions only
    - Employees are BLOCKED from accessing letters (critical security requirement)
    - Admin has full access to all data

  2. Policies Created
    - profiles: Users view/update own, admins view all
    - employee_coupons: Employees view own, public can validate active coupons
    - subscriptions: Users view own, admins view all
    - commissions: Employees view own, admins manage all
    - letters: Subscribers view/create/update own, employees blocked, admins full access

  3. Helper Function
    - get_user_role() - Returns current user's role for policy checks
