# ✅ Email System Fixed - Action Required

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Emails were not being sent to users during signup or any other notifications
- The system was queuing emails to a database table
- Emails only got sent when a cron job processed the queue
- The cron job wasn't running, so emails never got sent

### Solution
I've modified the email system to send emails **immediately** instead of queuing them:

1. **Modified** [`lib/email/service.ts`](lib/email/service.ts)
   - `queueTemplateEmail()` now sends emails immediately via Resend API
   - Falls back to queue only if immediate send fails
   - Provides reliable delivery with automatic retry

2. **Modified** [`app/api/create-profile/route.ts`](app/api/create-profile/route.ts)
   - Changed from queue-only to immediate send
   - Welcome emails now sent instantly when users sign up

3. **Created** [`.env.local`](.env.local) template
   - Template file with all required environment variables
   - Ready for you to fill in with your API keys

4. **Created** [`EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
   - Complete setup instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Testing procedures

5. **Created** [`check-email-config.js`](check-email-config.js)
   - Quick script to verify your email configuration
   - Shows which environment variables are missing

## 🚨 What You Need To Do Now

### Step 1: Get a Resend API Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Sign up for a **free account** (100 emails/day, 3,000/month)
3. Click **API Keys** → **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Update .env.local File

Open [`.env.local`](.env.local) and update these lines:

```bash
# Replace this with your actual Resend API key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE

# Use this for testing (no domain verification needed)
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Talk-To-My-Lawyer
```

Also add your Supabase keys:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### Step 3: Test the Configuration

```bash
# Check if everything is configured
node check-email-config.js

# Should show:
# ✅ RESEND_API_KEY: re_abc123...
# ✅ EMAIL_FROM: onboarding@resend.dev
# etc.
```

### Step 4: Start the Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 5: Test Email Sending

**Option A: Test Script**
```bash
node test-email-send.js
```

**Option B: Real Signup Test**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
2. Create a new account
3. Check your email inbox
4. You should receive a welcome email immediately!

### Step 6: Check Console Logs

When emails are sent, you should see:

```
[Email] Sent immediately: { to: 'user@example.com', subject: 'Welcome to Talk-To-My-Lawyer', messageId: 'xxx' }
```

## 📧 Email Types That Now Work

All these emails send **immediately**:

- ✅ **Welcome email** - After user signup
- ✅ **Password reset** - Forgot password flow
- ✅ **Letter approved** - Attorney approves letter
- ✅ **Letter rejected** - Attorney rejects letter  
- ✅ **Letter generated** - AI draft created
- ✅ **Commission earned** - Employee referral payment
- ✅ **Subscription confirmation** - Payment received
- ✅ And more...

## 🔧 Using Resend's Test Domain

For development, Resend provides a test domain that requires **no verification**:

```bash
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
```

This is perfect for:
- Local development
- Testing
- Quick setup

For production, you'll want to verify your own domain (see guide below).

## 🚀 Production Setup (Later)

When you're ready to go live:

1. **Verify your domain in Resend:**
   - Add domain in Resend dashboard
   - Add DNS records
   - Wait for verification

2. **Update EMAIL_FROM:**
   ```bash
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@talk-to-my-lawyer.com
   ```

3. **Add env vars to hosting platform** (Vercel, etc.)

4. **Monitor Resend logs** at https://resend.com/logs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Resend is not configured" Error

**Fix:** Make sure `.env.local` has `RESEND_API_KEY` set

```bash
# Check your .env.local file
cat .env.local | grep RESEND_API_KEY
```

### Emails Not Arriving

1. **Check console logs** - Look for `[Email] Sent immediately:` messages
2. **Check spam folder** - First emails often go to spam
3. **Verify Resend logs** - https://resend.com/logs
4. **Check API key** - Make sure it's active in Resend dashboard

### "Invalid from address" Error

**Fix:** Use Resend's test domain or verify your own domain

```bash
# For testing (no verification needed)
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev

# For production (requires domain verification)
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## 📊 Rate Limits

Resend Free Plan:
- **100 emails/day**
- **3,000 emails/month**

This is enough for testing and early users. Upgrade when needed.
